            <p class="notice">Notice!</p>
            <p>During excessive hot or colds spells by the weather, if Tarantulas-Bulgaria.com considers the weather to
                be a
                danger to any shipped creatures, Tarantulas-Bulgaria.com may withhold an order at it’s own discretion
                until we
                consider it safe for the order to be shipped. This will be communicated at our earliest convenience to

            <p class="shipping-titles">Shipping Risks</p>
            <p>Shipping creatures and products will always carry risk on the side of the sender and the receiver.
                Tarantulas-Bulgaria.com nor any of it’s service providers can 100% guarantee that creatures will arrive
                at their destination safely, unharmed and in good health. In order to get parcels around the country as
                fast as possible, couriers use various methods of transport like cars, trucks, trains and aeroplanes via
                hundreds of pairs of hands in order to get the parcels to their destinations on time. Covering these
                long distances brings the risk of creatures suffering at the hands of these main threats; cold, heat,
                dehydration and or a destroyed parcel.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p class="shipping-titles">D.O.A (Dead on Arrival)</p>
            <p>In a D.O.A. case where a creature has died during transit, Tarantulas-Bulgaria.com will once per shipped
                order, consider crediting the customer 50% of the price of the creature/s in question.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p class="shipping-titles">Exclusion</p>
            <p>We are prepared to replace a creature that has died in transit as long as the cause of the of the death
                is due to poor packaging or handling by us or a courier service we have used. But in a case where
                deliveries do not go as planned due to matters out of our control, i.e., national strikes, political /
                public unrest, acts of God, severe weather and other causes that are totally out of our control, we can
                not be held liable for any loss whatsoever.</p>
