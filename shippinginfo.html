            until we

        <p class="shipping-titles">Shipping Risks</p>
        <p>Shipping creatures and products will always carry risk on the side of the sender and the receiver.
            Tarantulas-Bulgaria.com nor any of it’s service providers can 100% guarantee that creatures will arrive
            at their destination safely, unharmed and in good health. In order to get parcels around the country as
            fast as possible, couriers use various methods of transport like cars, trucks, trains and aeroplanes via
            hundreds of pairs of hands in order to get the parcels to their destinations on time. Covering these
            long distances brings the risk of creatures suffering at the hands of these main threats; cold, heat,
            dehydration and or a destroyed parcel.</p>

    <section>
        <p class="shipping-titles">D.O.A (Dead on Arrival)</p>
        <p>In a D.O.A. case where a creature has died during transit, Tarantulas-Bulgaria.com will once per shipped
            order, consider crediting the customer 50% of the price of the creature/s in question.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p class="shipping-titles">Exclusion</p>
        <p>We are prepared to replace a creature that has died in transit as long as the cause of the of the death
            is due to poor packaging or handling by us or a courier service we have used. But in a case where
            deliveries do not go as planned due to matters out of our control, i.e., national strikes, political /
            public unrest, acts of God, severe weather and other causes that are totally out of our control, we can
            not be held liable for any loss whatsoever.</p>
